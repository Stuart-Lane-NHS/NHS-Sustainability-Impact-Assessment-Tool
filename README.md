# NHS-Sustainability-Impact-Assessment-Tool
This SIA tool has been developed by Stuart Lane - Sustainability and Carbon Manager at University Hospitals Dorset. 
This tool is designed to be compatible with the Centre for Sustainable Healthcare's Sus QI methodology and adopts elements of the scanning exercises in Sus QI. This SIA tool also incorporates components of the Social Value Model, meaning that it aligns with the framework adopted to guide management of social value within NHS procurement. Methodologies have however been expanded and amended to close perceived gaps and to help reconcile with Greener NHS "Themes".
This repository contains the template SIA spreadsheet tool and guests are invited to download and make use of the tool, feeding back so that improvements can be made and shared with this community for the benefit of all.
There is also a slideshow which gives a little background into the rational for how the tool has been contructed and and learnings around implementation.
The intention is to share this tool in the hope that it assists some and to test the appetite for developing a group of users that are happy enough with the template to adopt and collaborate with ongoing refinements / educational material etc.
It is recognised that some NHS organisations already have their own SIA methodology and that they may be happy with that. Others may wish to develope an SIA approach which deviates from this template.
